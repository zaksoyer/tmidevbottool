#### **THANKS for using TDBT, TMi Dev Bot Tool**

This tool connects on Twitch, joins the user's chat room and stores all datas provided by event handlers as an object.  Datas can be stored in a unique file or in separated file for each events.
 						
You can also use this as a skeleton for a Twitch bot, since it contains all events triggered by TMi.  NOTE : due to the massive amount of data provied by the `raw_message` event, this one is commented.  Just uncomment it to access the datas.
 
#### **PLEASE DO NOT REPORT any bug** you could find, other then the TMi librairy doesn't exist anymore so I can update/remove the whole thing.  If you can't debug this, creating a bot will be a hard task to accomplish.. not impossible, but hard!
